                <li>
                    Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, 
                    and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew up with one sister, 
                    Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. Jobs 
                    remembers his father as being very skilled at working with his hands.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California. This area, just 
                    south of Palo Alto, California, was becoming a center for electronics. 
                    Electronics form the basic elements of devices such as radios, televisions, 
                    stereos, and computers. At that time people started to refer to the area as 
                    "Silicon Valley." This is because a substance called silicon is used in the manufacturing of electronic parts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself. He swam competitively, 
                    but was not interested in team sports or other group activities. He showed 
                    an early interest in electronics and gadgetry. He spent a lot of time working 
                    in the garage workshop of a neighbor who worked at Hewlett-Packard, 
                    an electronics manufacturer.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Jobs also enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club. There he saw engineers 
                    demonstrate new products, and he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. 
                    He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    While in high school Jobs attended lectures at the Hewlett-Packard plant. On one 
                    occasion he boldly asked William Hewlett (1931–2001), the president, for some 
                    parts he needed to complete a class project. Hewlett was so impressed he gave 
                    Jobs the parts, and offered him a summer internship at Hewlett-Packard.

                <li>
                    After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs attended Reed College in 
                    Portland, Oregon, for two years. He dropped out after one semester to 
                    visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974. In 1975 
                    Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a 
                    technical whiz named Steve Wozniak (1950–), was trying to build a small 
                    computer. Jobs became fascinated with the marketing potential of such a 
                    computer. In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it 
                    Apple Computer Company, in memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking 
                    apples. They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling Jobs's microbus 
                    and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit boards (the boards 
                    that hold the internal components of a computer) while they worked on the 
                    computer prototype (sample).

                <li>
                    Jobs had realized there was a huge gap in the computer market. At that time 
                    almost all computers were mainframes. They were so large that one could fill 
                    a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them. Advances 
                    in electronics, however, meant that computer components were getting smaller 
                    and the power of the computer was increasing.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Jobs and Wozniak redesigned their computer, with the idea of selling it to 
                    individual users. The Apple II went to market in 1977, with impressive first 
                    year sales of $2.7 million. The company's sales grew to $200 million within 
                    three years. This was one of the most phenomenal cases of corporate growth 
                    in U.S. history. Jobs and Wozniak had opened an entirely new market—personal 
                    computers. Personal computers began an entirely new way of processing information.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway. Apple was continually 
                    forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered 
                    the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered 
                    technical and marketing problems. It was withdrawn from the market, and was 
                    later reworked and reintroduced.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Jobs continued to be the marketing force behind Apple. Early in 1983 he unveiled 
                    the Lisa. It was designed for people possessing minimal computer experience. It 
                    did not sell well, however, because it was more expensive than personal computers 
                    sold by competitors. Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines 
                    (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share 
                    (part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM.

                <li>
                    Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company called 
                    NeXT. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco, 
                    aimed at the educational market. Initial reactions were generally good. The product was 
                    very user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays, and an 
                    outstanding sound system. Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught 
                    on. It was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers 
                    or run common software.
                </li>

                <h1 class="heading">Toy Story</h1>
                <li>
                    NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased a small company called Pixar 
                    from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–). Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine years later Pixar 
                    released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, 
                    which Disney distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely successful. Monsters, 
                    Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film in history.

                <h1 class="heading">NeXT and Apple</h1>
                <li>
                    In December of 1996 Apple purchased NeXT Software for over $400 million. Jobs returned to Apple as a 
                    part-time consultant to the chief executive officer (CEO). The following year, in a surprising event, 
                    Apple entered into a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two companies, according to the 
                    New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts." Over the next six years 
                    Apple introduced several new products and marketing strategies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the Internet and by 
                    telephone. The Apple Store became a runaway success. Within a week it was the third-largest e-commerce 
                    site on the Internet. In September of 1997 Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    In 1998 Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an affordable price. 
                    The iBook was unveiled in July 1999. This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It 
                    includes Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the cordless phone that would allow the user to surf the 
                    Internet wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs unveiled Apple's new Internet strategy. It included a group of 
                    Macintosh-only Internet-based applications. Jobs also announced that he was becoming the permanent CEO 
                    of Apple.
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs said, "The thing that drives me and my colleagues … is that 
                    you see something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to get it, but you know, sometimes 
                    intuitively, it's within your grasp. And it's worth putting in years of your life to make it come into 
                    existence." Jobs has worked hard to translate his ideas into exciting and innovative products for businesses 
                    and consumers. He was instrumental in launching the age of the personal computer. Steve Jobs is truly a 
                    computer industry visionary.
